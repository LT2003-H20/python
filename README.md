# Advanced Python

In the task folder you will find a list of scripts. Each script is equivalent to one task. Your assignment is to
solve a set of G tasks and a VG task. To solve a task you follow the instructions in the comment in each script.

Task should be solved in groups. You are divided into groups during the first meeting which will take place on the course Zoom (see main page for the course).
For those who do not attend the first meeting, send me a message and I'll create new groups with students that did not attend the first meeting.


## Detailed Instructions:


1)  One in your group forks this repo. The fork will be like a "copy" of this repo. 
2) The one who forked the repo should invite the other group member to the fork repo
3)  make a new branch called group_X where X is your group number.
NOTE! even if only one person can do the above, please do it together in the group by sharing screen.
3)  read instructions in the task script, solve it
( 3.5) ask me questions if stuck)
5)  commit solution to branch for each task. IMPORTANT! make sure that EACH member of the group makes at least ONE commit!
6)  create a pull request, requesting a merge of your feature branch to the main branch or the main repo, not your fork repo.
(+ Make sure you do not commit any script or file that is not in the original repo.)
7) go to Exercise 3: Advanced Topics in Python on canvas and submitt the link to your pull request

Each group will have to solve their alloted tasks (see below). Task are divided into two groups G and VG. The G group
consist of some easy task and one a bit harder and the VG group will be one hard task.


## Grading

solving majority of G tasks will give you a G, solving majority of the G tasks + the VG task gives you a VG.

In addition to solving the tasks you need to do the following to be able to pass the assignments:
-   each individual student have to have made one commit to the group branch.
-   group should have made a pull request

You will be expected to solve the task as a group

NOTE! tasks between groups do not necessarily cover the same concepts so i strongly suggest that you after submission check out the solutions to the task that you did not get alloted.
