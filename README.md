# Advanced Python

In the task folder you will find a list of scripts. Each script is equivalent to one task. Your assignment is to
solve a set of G tasks and a VG task.

To solve a task you follow the instructions in the comment in each script. A task is only solved when the
solution is passed by the belonging test which you can find in tests/. To be clear; if your solution passes the
test you can view the task as solved. However, i will do manual checks, especially for VG so tests are not 
cheater (or if my tests are bad..)

you can test your solutions by running:

`python -m unittest -v` 

Detailed Instructions:


1)  use you github to clone the repo
2)  one in your group should create a branch with the name of your group. This will be the branch
    you will work on
3)  read instructions in the task script, solve it
( 3.5) if confused or have question which i expect you to have ask me)
4)  test is by running the testing command
5)  commit solution to branch for each task. IMPORTANT! make sure that EACH member of the group makes at least one commit!
6)  submit assignment by creating a pull request, requesting a merge of your feature branch to the main branch

Each group will have to solve their alloted tasks (see below). Task are divided into two groups G and VG. The G group
consist of some easy task and one a bit harder and the VG group will be one hard task.


Grading

solving all G tasks will give you a G, solving majority of the G tasks + the VG task gives you a VG.

You will be expected to solve the task as a group

Furthermore, for each individual student to pass they have to have made on commit to the group branch.


Lastly, i suggest after submission that you check out the other tasks and the other students solutions!
