# Advanced Python

In the task folder you will find a list of scripts. Each script contain a at least one task.
Solving all the tasks contained in a script will grant you points. Point distribution is shown below.

You cannot chose a to solve two of the same type of task, i.e. you cannot chose to solve list_comp1 and list_comp2. 
You can only chose one task per type.

To solve the task you follow the instructions in the comment in each task script. A task is only solved when the
solution is passed by the belonging test which you can find in tests/.

to run the test you can run:

`python -m unittest -v` 

to pass this part of the course you need to have collected X points, to get vg you need to have collected X points.


1)  you need to work in a group of 2-3 people
2)  each group has to solve at minimum 3 tasks
3)  each person in the group has to submit one of the task by a pull request to main branch on this repo.
    To be clear, you should solve the task together but each one in the group as to at least once make a pull request 
    to the main branch.

lastly, only one group can solve the 2 point task but for the 7 points task 2 groups can solve the same.
