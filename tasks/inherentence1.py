"""
Create the following classes using class inheretence
1: Animal
2: Fish
3: Tuna
4: Mammal
5: Dolphin

make sure the following will run: (>> CODE -> OUTPUT)

>> billy = Tuna()
>> billy.live -> "sea"
>> billiy.predator -> True
>> billy.cat -> "fish"
>> billiy.water_type() -> "freashwater"
>> billiy.reproduce() -> "laying eggs"

>> steve = Dolphin()
>> steve.live -> "sea"
>> steve.predator -> True
>> steve.cat -> "mamal"
>> steve.reproduce() -> "giving birth"
>> steve.talk() -> "squeak squeak!"


make sure following will fail /not run:
>> bob = fish()
>> steve.water_type()
>> billy.talk()

retrictions:

1) you should not be able to create an object that is only an animal or fish, it has to be a individual species (e.g. tuna)
2) you should fill in the variables and functions as soon as possible in the hierarchy, i.e. variable "cat" 
should not be defined in e.g. Dolphin
3) make sure that creation of a class without category functions are impossible, e.g. throws and error. I.e. you should not
be able to create a species of fish, e.g. salmon without specifying water_type()
