Create the three following classes:

1: Animal
2: Fish
3: Tuna

Animal is the parent class
Fish is the child class of Animal
and Tuna is the child class of Animal

all Animals have to have two functions and two variables:

# varibles:
# cat  <- specifiy the category. ( for Animal category can be "living thing", for Fish it should be "Animal" and for Tuna "Fish")
# live <- where it lives ("everywhere", "land", "water" etc, its arbitrary )

# functions:
# move() 
# eat()


Tuna should have two variables:

varibles:
cat  <- specifiy the category. ( for Animal category can be "living thing", for Fish it should be "Animal" and for Tuna "Fish")
live <- where it lives ("everywhere", "land", "water" etc, its arbitrary )

And two functions:

functions (just make this return a string, e.g. "by swimming", or "seaweed")
move() 
eat()

Now these are the grading rules:

1) you should not be able to create an object that is only an animal or fish
2) you should fill in the variables and functions as soon as possible in the hierarchy.
3)
