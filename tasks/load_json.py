"""
create a function that called load_json() which loads data/json_data.json, extracts the sentences
and puts them into a pandas.DataFrame with three columns [sentence_id, word_id, word], where a row
is a one word.

NOTE! the json file is corrupt so you have to manually correct the errors in it to make it load.


DataFrame Example:

dataframe ->    | sentence_id | word_id | word   |
                -----------------------------------
                | 0           | 0       | "hello"|
                | 1           | 0       | "bye"  |
